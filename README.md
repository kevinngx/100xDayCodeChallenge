# 100xDayCodeChallenge

This is my 100 days of code challenge based on Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code course on Udemhy which runs through multiple projects in Python.
The purpose of this challenge is to challenge myself as a self taught programmer to continuously develop my coding programming skills and document my journey from a python beginner to an intermediate developer.
The majority of projects within this document will be guided by the course, however, throughout the 100 day period if such projects & challenges come up I will also upload them here.
